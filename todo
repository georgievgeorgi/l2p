check that border feature works, with differnent color opts and geom;
incl. transparency; also write docs for it

- Make a read_expression() sub that acts as an expression iterator in
reading, to abstract out the parsing options ($$-expr
vs. \begin{}-\end{}, etc).  Include tests for it, of course.
x - Do I want to make wrapping $ around the arugument to -i optional?
-  -I option, which is like -i, but puts $'s around the expression for you
- remove debug info
- let -p argument be encased in quotes, and separated by spaces & comments
- example using -B option
- make -F deal with multipage docs.  You can implement the workaround
  in the docs
- option to specify arbitrary imagemagick options
- detect latex errors by checking return value of latex executable
- multiple -i arguments? 
x - documentation on wrapping option arguments in quotes
x + allow an optional # prefix to hex triplets
x - in COLORS section of docs, make note that they may need to put the color
  in quotes
x + add option to install a (transparent?) border
- document error codes
- support for job spec (XML file?)
x - put a version in a variable, and have it incorporated in the
  perldoc somehow? 
x - recognize 3-char color codes (e.g. F00 for red)
